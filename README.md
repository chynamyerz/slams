Smart Lecture Attendance Monitoring System is a web application developed by myself "Sifiso Myeza" as a final year project under the Department of Computer SCience at the Universit of Zululand with the superversion of one of my lecturers. It was developed using Angularjs as the Model View Controler and PHP to handle the back-end and PHPmyadmin with MySql for data storage with HTML and CSS including Bootstrap for front-end and also used Fusionchartjs for statistical graph representaion where necessary.

Please find the powerpoint presentation for the summary about this web application.

The data used is a real data because it was implemented to reflect the real life event of the attendance of students at the University of Zululand so please use the available data with care, concern and wisely.
